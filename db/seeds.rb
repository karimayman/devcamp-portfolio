# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#10.times do |what|
#  Blog.create!(title: "my blog #{what} ",
#  body: "whatever i write herfe is valid bitch")

#end
#puts"10 blogs created"
##5.times do |skills|
  #Skill.create!( title: "rails #{skills}",
